                <em>by C. S. Lewis A sermon preached in the Church of St. Mary the Virgin,

                A University is a society for the pursuit of learning. As
                students, you will be expected to make yourselves, or to
                start making yourselves, in to what the Middle Ages called
                clerks: into philosophers, scientists, scholars, critics, or
                historians. And at first sight this seems to be an odd thing to
                do during a great war. What is the use of beginning a task
                which we have so little chance of finishing? Or, even if we
                ourselves should happen not to be interrupted by death or
                military service, why should we -- indeed how can we --
                continue to take an interest in these placid occupations
                when the lives of our friends and the liberties of Europe are
                in the balance? Is it not like fiddling while Rome burns?

                Deep work is the ability to focus without distraction on a cognitively demanding task.
                It’s a skill that allows you to quickly master complicated 
                information and produce better results in less time. 
                Deep work will make you better at what you do and provide the sense of true fulfillment 
                that comes from craftsmanship. In short, deep work is like a super power in our increasingly 
                competitive twenty-first century economy. And yet, most people have lost the ability to go 
                deep—spending their days instead in a frantic blur of e-mail and social media, 
                not even realizing there’s a better way.
